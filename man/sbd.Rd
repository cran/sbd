\title{Size Biased Distributions}
\description{
Fitting and plotting parametric or non-parametric size-biased
non-negative distributions, with optional covariates in the case of
parametric. Supports three parametric options, log-normal, Weibull, and gamma.
}
\details{
The core function is \code{\link{sbm}}, which fits a model to
  non-negative observations to estimate the average of the underlying
  distribution assuming that the probability of making an observation is
  proportional to the size of that observation. The default gives a
  non-parametric fit (the harmonic mean), and three parametric options are
  also available: log-normal, Weibull, and gamma. Covariates can be included
  in parametric models. The output is a list of class \code{sbm}, which has
  methods \code{plot}, \code{predict}, \code{summary}, and \code{AIC}. The
  functions were developed to support the analysis of speed observations from
  camera trap data described by Rowcliffe et al. (2016).
